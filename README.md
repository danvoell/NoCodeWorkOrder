# NoCodeWorkOrder
Goofing around with Google Form, Google Sheets and Zapier to create a simple free Work Order System

This probably doesn't deserve a repository but I wanted to open this up in the event others had ideas to make it better. If you have suggestions please email dan@midwestlabelsupply.com.

Step 1. Create Google Form with order attributes.
Step 2. Create Google Sheet with form outputs
Step 3. Create Zapier which sends an email to customer when new row goes into sheet
